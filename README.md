What have I learned from this small project using Postman:

* Writing and using unit tests – Learning how to create unit tests to ensure individual components of the code work as expected.
* Unit testing for HTTP POST requests – Testing the functionality of HTTP POST requests to ensure data is correctly sent to the server.
* Integration testing for HTTP POST requests – Validating that different parts of the system work together when making HTTP POST requests.
* Error handling in tests – Implementing proper error handling in tests to manage unexpected issues effectively.
* Testing HTTP GET requests for reading all data – Ensuring that the HTTP GET requests successfully retrieve all the data from the server.
* Testing HTTP GET requests for querying data by ID – Verifying that HTTP GET requests can retrieve specific data based on its ID.
* Testing HTTP PUT requests – Ensuring that HTTP PUT requests are correctly updating data on the server.
* Testing HTTP DELETE requests – Validating that HTTP DELETE requests successfully remove data from the server.
